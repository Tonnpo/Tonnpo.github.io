    <h2>About This Blog</h2>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student in mathematics at the Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California, USA. My research areas focus on mathematical finance, asset pricing, and, machine learning.

    <p>
      I document my study, research, thoughts, and experiments in this blog. The content is primarily for my own reference, but I hope it can also be useful to others interested in similar topics.
